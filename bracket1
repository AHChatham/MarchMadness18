# NOTES: for most rounds; random select division per round to start with random code below for matchup;

DIVISION SELECTOR CODE:

from random import *
 
items = ['South','West','East','Midwest']
 
x = sample(items,  1)  
print x[0]


CODE TO RANDOMLY SELECT WINNER BASED OFF SEEDS; NEED TO INPUT SEED NUMBERS INTO variables topseed and lowseed:
topseed = 3
lowseed = 13

spread = topseed + lowseed

import random
for x in range(1):
  v = random.randint(1, spread)
  
  
  if v <= topseed:
  	print "low wins"
  else:
    print "high wins"



FOR FINAL 4 AND CHAMPIONSHIP GAME-
	random select winners by division because seeds less important here; also several are same
